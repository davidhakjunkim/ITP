## 1. Values, Types, and Operators

Things I already knew

- I already had a little understanding of th concept of binary. At first, I didn't understand how 0 and 1 made computers think and work, but now I understand it better. I'm curious about how many 0 and 1 are used to play games

New information

- I was amazed by JavaScript's automatic type conversion feature. When an operator used a value of the wrong type, JavaScript automatically calculated what I nedded and converted the value to the required type.

## 2. Program Structure

Things I already knew

- I knew about the existence of comment text. I'd seen HTML before I studied programming. While I couldn't understand other parts, I was often fascinated by complete sentences that seemed to speak to a human being. Those were comments.

New information

- When two or more statements exist, the program's original control flow is linear, but I discovered that by specifying various conditions, the control flow can change and sometimes even loop. Presenting statements and adding conditions to make the program work the way I want felt like I was having a conversation with a computer.

## 3. Functions

Things I already knew

- Actually, I didn't know much about the concept of functions in programming. Even when I was young and coding with Scratch, I could only program using simple Lego-like block stacking, and within those blocks, I often grouped repetitive code. But now that I know that's part of the concept of functions, I want to learn more about them.

New information

- I used to think that the concept of functoins in programming was difficult, but I've come to understand a little bit about the concept of function as defining vocabulary in various parts so that the program can be created in the way I want.
